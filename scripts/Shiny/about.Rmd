## About

**TF rank**: to select the top ranked TFs per condition basing on their estimated activity, e.g. *TF rank = 2* will select the two most active TFs under each condition.

**Target-Lipid likelihood threshold**: to select the Target-Lipid relationships having a likelihood >= this threshold.

**Sort by**: whether to sort the rows of the data by TF ranks or Target-Lipid likelihood.

*Notes*:

The *cor* column corresponds to the correlation coefficient (bicor coeff) between each target gene and lipid.
The *likelihood* is calculated by deviding *cor/max(cor)* in each Target-Lipid sub_network.
